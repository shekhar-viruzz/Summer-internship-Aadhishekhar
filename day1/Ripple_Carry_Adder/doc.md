# ⚡ 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (Verilog HDL)

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **4-bit Ripple Carry Adder** using Verilog HDL.  
It performs binary addition of two 4-bit inputs along with a carry-in.

The design is built using **full adders connected in series**, where carry propagates from LSB to MSB.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 4-bit binary addition
- Carry-in support
- Modular full adder design
- Ripple carry propagation
- Simulation verified using testbench

---

## 🧠 Working Principle

Each full adder performs:
- Sum = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin  
- Carry = majority logic of inputs  

Carry output of one stage feeds the next stage.

## 🔌 Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
- `a[3:0]` → First operand  
- `b[3:0]` → Second operand  
- `cin` → Input carry  

### Outputs
- `s[3:0]` → Sum output  
- `cout` → Final carry-out

## 🧪 Test Cases

| A | B | Cin | Sum | Cout | Description |
|---|---|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| 0000 | 0000 | 0 | 0000 | 0 | Reset |
| 0010 | 0100 | 0 | 0110 | 0 | Simple addition |
| 0010 | 0100 | 1 | 0111 | 0 | With carry-in |
| 1110 | 0110 | 1 | 0111 | 1 | Overflow case |
| 0011 | 1100 | 1 | 0000 | 1 | Full carry propagation |

## 📊 Waveform Explanation

- Carry starts at LSB  
- Propagates through each full adder  
- Final carry appears at MSB stage  
- Delay increases with bit position
